# üîê Quantum RSA Break Demo (Shor Algorithm)

This is an educational, experiment-oriented project demonstrating how **RSA encryption** can be broken by a **quantum algorithm** called **Shor's Algorithm**, simulated using IBM's Qiskit library.

---

## üß† How It Works

1. A number or short word is encrypted using classical RSA.
2. The public modulus `n = p * q` is set to a small number (e.g., 35), small enough for quantum simulation.
3. Shor's Algorithm is run to find the prime factors of `n`.
4. If successful, the program recovers the private key and decrypts the original message.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

Due to the computational complexity of quantum simulations on classical hardware:

- Only **small numbers** (< 35) can be encrypted and broken.
- Larger inputs will be rejected with a helpful message.
- Real-world RSA keys are **thousands of bits** and require real quantum hardware to be broken.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the main demo

```bash
python rsa_shor_input_demo_final.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a number or a short word to encrypt.
